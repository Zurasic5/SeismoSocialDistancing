# SeismoSocialDistancing

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook project that analyzes the impact of reduced human activity during the COVID-19 pandemic on seismic noise levels. The study uses seismic data to explore how lockdowns and mobility restrictions influenced background noise observed at seismic stations.

Key methods applied include:

Spectrogram analysis to visualize temporal variations in seismic noise across different frequency bands.
Displacement RMS (Root Mean Square) calculations to quantify changes in noise levels before, during, and after lockdown periods.

The results demonstrate how anthropogenic activity, such as transportation and industrial operations, significantly contributes to seismic noise, and how their reduction during the pandemic led to observable decreases in seismic background levels.

Tools & Libraries: Python, ObsPy, NumPy, Matplotlib, Pandas

This project highlights the interdisciplinary connection between seismology and societal events, offering insights into how global human behavior can be reflected in Earthâ€™s seismic records.
